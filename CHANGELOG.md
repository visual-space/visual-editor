## [0.5.0] Markers [#69](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/69)
* Added custom markers. Multiple marker types can be defined. The client app can define callbacks for hovering the markers.
  * Split the AttributeM static properties in methods in multiple files
  * Refactored the `DropdownButton` in Toolbar to make it more generic
  * Added demo page for the markers and highlights features
  * Various small code cleanups
* Added new method in the editor controller `toggleMarkers()`. It toggles all markers at once. [#111](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/111)
* Markers - Initial visibility config parameter [#116](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/116)
* Markers - Marker attachments, Position widgets in sync with the markers found in the text [#117](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/117)
  * Retrieved the pixel coordinates of the markers rectangles that are drawn in `EditableTextLine`. Also retrieved the global position of each line of text. This information is essential for rendering attached widgets.
  * Added unique ids to markers to facilitate precise targeting when deleting or attaching widgets.
  * Added a dedicated `MarkersState` where the rendered markers and their pixel coordinates are stored. 
  * Fixed an issue with the conversion from json data to `NodeM` of markers attributes. When the markers were first implemented, by mistake, we stored the json data instead of the converted `NodeM` models when initialising the document and `StyleM`. Because of this error all markers were passed as json data, therefore some of the code is harder to read. This was fixed and now we are receiving `MarkerM` instead of json data.
  * Exposed 2 callbacks: `onBuildComplete()`, `onScrooll()`. These callbacks are essential for synchronising the attached widgets positions to the markers themselves.
  * Added new demo page to demonstrate how to attach arbitrary widgets to the markers.
* Markers - Paragraphs with markers don't get rendered if the editor is not scrollable (bugfix) [#118](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/118)
  * `scrollController` is no longer mandatory. It is possible for the editor to have the scroll disabled, so no scroll controller needed.
* Highlights - Add highlights from the controller. Improve the highlights page [#145](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/145)
* Highlights - Restore highlights hovering [#134](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/134)
  * Added ids to highlights. If we are using a pure functional approach in our code we can no longer rely on references to search for highlights in the state store. We need ids to be able to track which highlights are hovered.
* Markers - Render attachments for the selection (for quick menu) [#135](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/135)
  * Upgraded the highlights hovering service to use pixel coordinates instead of text position to detect the hovering.
  * Added a markers hovering service.
  * Added demo page to demonstrate how to attach menus or random widgets when tapping on highlights and markers or when changing the selection.
  * Exported the rectangles data for the selection. Now we have to ways of attaching widgets to the text selection. Read [Selection](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/blob/develop/lib/selection/selection.md) documentation for more details.
* Documents - Delta Sandbox does not trigger update of the json input when changing styles. Fixed by using the newly added `onBuildComplete()` callback. The sandbox json preview now updates on any change including style changes and adding markers/highlights. [#93](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/93)

## [0.4.0] Bug Fixing
* Fixed issue with `EditorController` being reinitialised on setState(). Usually setState() should not be used. However there are scenarios when the host code might request the entire editor to update (for example when changing styles). Prior to this fix the editor was crashing completely. When a client app triggers `setState()` it also rebuilds the `EditorController` if the first controller instance is not cached by the developer. When a new controller is created a new internal state store object is created as well. In this state store we also keep references towards several important classes: ScrollController, FocusNode, EditorRenderer. The issue came from the fact that these references were not properly renewed. In many places of the code base we have code snippets that depend on the latest refs being available. The fix was to patch the newly created state store with the proper refs. In the old Quill Repo this was present but due to the lack of documentation this code got discarded. Now this fix restores this functionality but with the necessary changes to make it work within the refactored codebase of Visual editor. [#77](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/77)
* Added delta json preview page. In this page you can see the json output as you type in the editor. Very helpful for learning quickly how the delta format works. [#66](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/66)
* Fixes related to the architecture cleanup refactoring. During the refactoring, despite our best efforts, some bugs showed up:
  * Tapping the toolbar buttons does not update their state (Post Refactoring) [#84](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/84)
  * Dual editors - Text is inserted in the wrong editor instance (Post Refactoring) - Added unique focusNodes. [#85](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/85)
  * After setState() in parent the selection no longer works + selecting text before setState() yields missing doc after setState() (Post Refactoring) [#86](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/86)
  * After controller reset, indenting, the bullet and number lists don't work (fails) (Post Refactor) [#87](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/87)
* Improved the toolbar documentation. [#86](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/86)
  * Added horizontal mouse scroll for toolbar.
  * Fixed the scroll controller which overlays over the toolbar buttons.
  * Fixed the toolbar stretching and irregular distance between buttons.

## [0.3.0] Architecture refactoring [#1](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/1)
* Cleaning up editor.dart
* Improved docs [#2](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/2)
* Break editor.dart in multiple files
* Split source code in modules
* Updated linting options (removed some restrictions to improve readability)
* Moved all legacy files in /core to prepare for new modules
* Renamed to Visual Editor
* Bumped to Flutter 3.0.0 [#25](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/25)
* Removed the mixins from RawEditor
* Separated code into services.
* Refactored many methods to avoid reading/manipulating values straight from the RawEditor context.
  This reduces the coupling, enabling us to isolate code into services that can be unit tested.
* Merged Editor and RawEditor.
* Replaced ChangeNotifiers with state streams.
* Added migration guide [#60](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/60)
* Updated demo pages [#63](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/63)
* Migrated state architecture from singleton to one state per editor controller instance. [#61](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/61)
* Exported the Toolbar buttons so that custom toolbars can be build from scratch [#65](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/65)
* Delta documents sandbox page, preview the json (development aid)
* Remove tuple dependency [#45](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/45)
* Fix the placeholder is not displayed bug [#70](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/70)
* The caret is no longer displayed in readonly mode. The `showCursor` configuration option for `VisualEditor` was removed. It makes no sense to have the cared showing up in readonly mode. Or the caret missing in editable mode. [#73](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/73)
* Added first automatic test [#3](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/3)
* Renamed class that was colliding with the `Text class from Flutter [#33](https://github.com/visual-space/visual-editor/issues/33)

## [0.2.0] Highlights
* Custom highlights. This feature was initially developed for Quill. However we had major issues with the existing architecture. Therefore we decided to fork and run a major refactoring.

## [0.1.0] Quill Fork
* Rich text editor forked from [Flutter Quill](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill) and based on the Delta format.
