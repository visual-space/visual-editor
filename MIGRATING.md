# Migrating from Quill

Visual Editor is a fork of Flutter Quill. The main reason we separated from Quill was the opaque
architecture. We needed an easy to maintain code base, however the architecture of Quill made it
really hard to follow the code flow and adding improvements was difficult at best. Therefore we
decided to completely refactor the general architecture of Quill and reorganise it into modules,
services, states and models. Due to these changes if you desire to migrate from Flutter Quill to
Visual Editor.

## Feedback Requested

If you encounter any difficulties during the migration please start a new ticket. We will attempt to
respond to your query and update this doc accordingly.

## Backwards Compatibility

Most of the features present in Flutter Quill have been preserved. However in time Visual Editor is
expected to drift. At the moment the migration process is rather easy to follow. However we can't
guarantee this for the long run. Changes over the years might make the two versions incompatible.

## Update Imports

If you are using a decent IDE you should be able to autoimport the required files by using the
context menu or pressing the autoimport hotkey.

Before:
`import 'package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart';`

After:
`import 'package:visual_editor/visual-editor.dart';`

Note that we renamed the `Text` class so we will no longer colide with the Text class from Flutter.

## Renamed Classes

Most of the top classes have been renamed to better reflect the new architecture.

- `QuillEditor` - `VisualEditor`
- `QuillController` - `EditorController`
- `QuillToolbar` - `EditorToolbar`
- `DefaultTextBlockStyle` - `TextBlockStyleM`
- `DefaultStyles` - `EditorStylesM`

## Model Classes Suffix

During the refactoring we decided to move all the model classes in distinct `/models` folders. All
model classes now use the M suffix to indicate they are a model classes. This convention is similar
to how Java suffixes interfaces with I.

- `Document` - `DocumentM`
- `Operation` - `OperationM`

## Editor Configuration

The migration of models includes also the properties of the VisualEditor. They are now separated to
a distinct model `EditorConfigM`. We made this choice to facilitate the transport of the config
properties trough the codebase a lot easier.

```dart
  Widget _buildWelcomeEditor(BuildContext context) {
  var quillEditor = QuillEditor(
    controller: _controller!,
    scrollController: _scrollController,
    scrollable: true,
    focusNode: _focusNode,
    autoFocus: false,
    readOnly: false,
    placeholder: 'Add content',
    expands: false,
    padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
    customStyles: DefaultStyles(
      h1: TextBlockStyleM(
          const TextStyle(
            fontSize: 32,
            color: Colors.black,
            height: 1.15,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w300,
          ),
          const Tuple2(16, 0),
          const Tuple2(0, 0),
          null
      ),
      sizeSmall: const TextStyle(fontSize: 9),
    ),
  );
```

Now becomes:

```dart
  Widget _buildWelcomeEditor(BuildContext context) {
  var visualEditor = VisualEditor(
    controller: _controller!,
    scrollController: _scrollController,
    focusNode: _focusNode,
    config: EditorConfigM(
      placeholder: 'Add blocks',
      customStyles: DefaultStyles(
        h1: TextBlockStyleM(
          const TextStyle(
            fontSize: 32,
            color: Colors.black,
            height: 1.15,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w300,
          ),
          VerticalSpacing(top: 16, bottom: 0),
          VerticalSpacing(top: 0, bottom: 0),
          null,
        ),
        sizeSmall: const TextStyle(fontSize: 9),
      ),
    ),
  );
```

**showCursor was removed**

The caret is no longer displayed in readonly mode. The `showCursor` configuration option for `VisualEditor` was removed. It makes no sense to have the cared showing up in readonly mode. Or the caret missing in editable mode.

## Toolbar Configuration

- `customIcons` becomes `customButtons` - We've renamed the property to better express it's purpose.
  When reading custom icons, it could be understood as giving the ability to replace the icon set on
  the existing buttons.
- `toolbarSectionSpacing` becomes `buttonsSpacing` - It suggested that it applies only to groups of
  buttons when in fact it applies to buttons and groups. Possibly this behavior will be reviewed to
  give better control on button and section spacings by adding a new property `sectionSpacing`.
- `EditorCustomIcon` becomes `EditorCustomButton` - Icons mean static images. Buttons indicate also
  a reaction when tapping.
